#Grading and Collaboration Policy

All the lab exercises must be completed to satisfaction (passed)
in order to sit for the exam. The final exam accounts for 60 % of
the final grade in the course, while the lab grade accounts for
the remaining 40 %. For the graded part of the lab, you will be
given a grade in the range 0-100 points, which will be translated
to a letter grade in the end, after the lab exam.

##Plagiarism Warning

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s
text or source code, will result in the grade F, and may be reported
to the university for administrative processing. Committing acts that
violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are
cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS.

*Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!*

##Slip Days

We have frequent lab handins in this course and to add some flexibility
to your schedule, we have adopted a scheme with *slip days*. This means
that if you cannot make a handin deadline, e.g. due to illness, resit
exams, or other conflicting deadlines, you can use up to a total of 
**five slip days** throughout the semester for free. Weekends and holidays
**are included** in your slip day budget. Slip days beyond the *five free days*
will count negatively towards your lab grade. For each extra slip day used,
your grade is reduced by 5 points.

##Approval Process

Once you have passed the necessary tests for approval/grading of one of
the labs *you must* come to the Linux lab (E454) and demonstrate/show your
code. *This is a requirement for approval.*

##Labs

**Labs 1-2:** The first two lab handins are mainly preparatory, and doing
a good job on these is important for the remaining part of lab. *They must
be completed individually.* We do encourage collaboration on learning the
material, e.g. pointing each other in the right direction and giving hints
and tips, but we *do not accept joint submissions* on these two labs.
You may discuss the assignments with others and help others, but you may
not copy answers or code from another student or make your code available
to others. These labs will *not be graded*, but must be completed to at least
the level of passing (> 60 points per lab). You will not be told your grade
points, only pass/fail.

**Labs 3-6:** The last four lab handins will be a larger project which will
require a significant amount of work. We expect students to form groups and
work together on these lab handins. For these lab handins the passing level
will also be > 60 points per lab. We will evaluate each handin separately 
and give the group a joint grade on the overall handins. The final lab grade
will be determined by the oral lab exam/demo. The lab exam will be conducted
individually.
