# Autograder

Autograder is a tool for students and teaching staff to manage the submission
and validation of lab assignments. All lab submissions from students are
handled using Git, a source code management system, and GitHub, a web-based
hosting service for Git source repositories.

Students push their updated lab submissions to GitHub. Every lab submission is
then processed by a custom continuous integration tool. This tool will run
several test cases on the submitted code. Autograder generates feedback that
let the students verify if their submission implements the required
functionality. This feedback is available through a web interface, which can
then be used by students to improve their submissions.

Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to register and sign up for the lab
